1. pwd —      When you first open the terminal, you are in the home directory of your user. 
              To know which directory you are in, you can use the “pwd” command. 
              It gives us the absolute path, which means the path that starts from the root. 
              The root is the base of the Linux file system. It is denoted by a forward slash( / ). 
              The user directory is usually something like "/home/username".
          
2. ls —       Use the "Is" command to know what files are in the directory you are in. 
              You can see all the hidden files by using the command "ls -a".
         
3. rm —       Use the rm command to delete files and directories. But rm cannot simply delete a directory.
              Use “rm -r” to delete a directory. 
              In this case, it deletes both the folder and the files in it.
4. touch —    The touch command is used to create a file. 
              It can be anything, from an empty txt file to an empty zip file. For example, “touch new.txt”.
5.  man & --help — To know more about a command and how to use it, use the man command. It shows the manual pages of the command. For example, “man cd” shows the manual pages of the cd command. 
                  Typing in the command name and the argument helps it show which ways the command can be used (e.g., cd –help).
